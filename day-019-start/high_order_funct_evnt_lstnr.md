## Higher Order Functions and Event Listeners

### Higher Order Functions
- Function that can work with other functions
  - Function that takes another functions as an input
  - works with it inside the body of the function
  - some other languages do not allow this


       def function_a(something):
          # Do this with something
          # Then do this
          # Finally do this

### Event Listeners

- https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.listen
- listen method
  - once start listening need to bind function that will be triggered when a particular key is clicked
