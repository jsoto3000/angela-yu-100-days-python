## Object State and Instances

### Object State and Instances

- have blueprint for object
  - can then have multiple instances of same object
  - separate versions of same object each with a different state and acting independent of each other
    - these multiple instances are independent of each other
      - timmy.color = green
      - tommy.color = purple
    - can have different attributes and methods
      - this is known as the objects' state
        - timmy and tommy objects have different states in terms of their appearance (color)
        - can also have different states in terms of what they are doing (methods)
