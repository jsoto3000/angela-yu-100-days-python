# For loop examples

'''
for item in list of items
    #Do something to each item

for number in range (a, b):
    print(number)
'''

# While loop

'''
while something_is_true:
    #Do something repeatedly
    
while something_is_true:
    #Do this
    #Then do this
    #Then do this

#For loops vs While loops

'''
Use for loops when iterating over a defined number of items or range.

Use for while loops when want program to run until a certain condition is met.
While loops are dangerous.
Can create an infinite loop.
