# Angela Yu - Python Day 17
## Classes, Attributes, Methods, and Class Constructors

- Use PascalCase for classes
- camelCase not used in Python
- snake_case everything else  


- attributes - information, qualities, properties
  - things it has  


- method - function attached to an object
  - things it does 
  - method unlike function always needs to have a 'self' parameter as the first parameter


- constructor is part of the blueprint that specifies what should happen when object is constructed
  - also known as <b><i>initialising</b></i>
    - set (variables, counters, switches, etc.) to their starting values at the beginning of a program or subroutine  
    - to clear (interanl memory, a disk, etc.) of previous data in preparation for use  
  - use __init__(self) function  to initialise attributes
    - when adding parameters to the constructor you are saying whenever a new object is constructed from that class then you must provide the parameters  
  - uses dot notation
